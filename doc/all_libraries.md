### luaproc

luaproc - a concurrent programming library for Lua

*"It uses coroutines and multiple independent states in Lua to implement Lua processes, which are user threads comprised of Lua code that have no shared data. Lua processes are executed by workers, which are system threads implemented with POSIX threads (pthreads), and thus can run in parallel.
Communication between Lua processes relies exclusively on message passing."*  -  see https://github.com/askyrme/luaproc.
